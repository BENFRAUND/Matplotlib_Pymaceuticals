# Results of Treatments Targeting Squamous Cell Carcinoma

### Study Design
* 10 groups of 25-26 mice each were administered nine different drug treatment regimes and placebo over the course of 45 days.
* Physiological responses, including change in tumor volume (mm3), number of metastatic sites, and mouse mortality were monitored and recorded at five day intervals during the course of treatment. 
* This analysis will focus on three of those treatments (Capomulin, Infubinol, Ketapril) compared to placebo.
   

### Tumor Response to Treatment

* Capomulin showed immediate, steady, and significant reductions in tumor volume over the 45 day period.

* After just five days, the mice on Capomulin were already showing reductions in tumor volume, while mice on the other two therapies and placebo had increased tumor volumes.

* Capomulin treatment resulted in an average 19% reduction in tumor volume by the end of the 45 days.  The reduction in Capomulin compared to placebo was significant, as evidenced by the 95% confidence interval lines in figure 2, which do not overlap with the placebo confidence intervals through most of the treatment period.

* Infubinol and Ketapril treatments did not show a significant difference from Placebo throughout the entire 45 day period, as indicated by the overlapping standard error of the means between Infubinol, Placebo, and Ketapril in figure 1.

### Metastatic Spread During Treatment 

* Capumolin was the most effective at controlling the spread of metastatic sites, limiting spread to a mean of less than 1.5 sites by the end of the 45 day period.  However, we cannot say that Capomulin is significantly better than Placebo on this measure, as indicated by the overalapping 95% confidence intervals (Capomulin upper 95% CI = 3.0 and Placebo lower 95% CI = 1.25 at day 45).

* Infubinol also appears to have controlled metastatic spread, however the upper 95% confidence intervals for the drug also show overlap with placebo, so we cannot say that the difference was significant.  In fact, figure 4 shows overlap of the confidence intervals between all four treatments.

* Ketapril's standard error of the mean overlaps with placebo, as seen in figure 3, indicating that there was not a significant difference between the drug and placebo throughout the entire course of treatment.

### Survival During Treatment

* Mice given Capomulin as treatment had a 84% survival rate at the end of the 45 day period.

* Mice given Infubinol, Ketapril or placebo had a survival rate of 44% or lower.

### Tumor Change Over 45 Day Treatment

* Capumolin yeilded an average 19% reduction in tumor volume over the 45 days of treatment, making it the only successful treatment of the three drugs administered, and significantly more successful than placebo.

* Mice that were administered Infubinol, Ketapril or Placebo had an average increase in tumor volume of between 46% and 57%.

### Future Studies

* The small size of each cohort (25-26 mice) contributed to greater uncertainty in the results of the study, as evidenced by the wide range for the 95% confidence intervals.  This was most apparent in the metastatic spread, where the confidence intervals overlapped between Capomulin and Placebo in figure 4.
* Using a similar total sample of 250 mice, future studies could narrow the number of treatments and use larger sample sizes per treatment to yield results with less uncertainty.
* While this study focused solely on the results of Capomulin, Infubinol and Ketapril, it is worth noting that mice treated with Ramicane had similarly successful results to those of Capomulin, as seen in figure 7, and should be studied further.
